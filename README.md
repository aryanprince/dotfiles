# Aryan's dotfiles
Here's some details about my setup:
- **OS**: Windows 11 + Ubuntu 20.04 WSL2
- **Terminal**: Windows Terminal
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **System Info Tools?** (those pretty logos and stats): [WinFetch for Windows](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch) and [NeoFetch for Linux](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
- **Wallpaper**: [This Koi wallpaper](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2200250797) from Wallpaper Engine
- **Editor**: VS Code + Neovim (only for quick edits)
- **Browser**: Edge

_Wait...it's all Microsoft? Always has been_

## PowerShell setup
- [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) - Prompt theme engine making everything pretty [with this theme](https://gist.github.com/aryanprince/7550ee863b0ea848ab5ce0fe5791093f) and [this](https://gist.github.com/aryanprince/93710640e69d3fd16bb10e66f16b7ae3)
- [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) - Huh...wonder what this is
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) - A command-line installer, like ``sudo apt get`` for Windows
- [Terminal Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons) - Folder and file icons in the terminal, pretty but heavy on cold boot
- [PSReadLine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/) - Cmdlets used for autocompletion and a few custom shortcuts 
- [PSFzf](https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf) - Fuzzy finder, set to Ctrl+R using PSRealLine
- [z](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/z) - Wow, this one's crazy - learns most _cd_-ed folders and can help jump to them with just a few letters 

## VS Code setup
- [(Theme) Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) - Minimal and clean
- [(Font) Fira Code]() - Love ligatures!
- [(File Icons) Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-material-theme-icons) - Again, minimal and matches the color theme
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - ACTUAL MAGIC, AI helps you code, sometimes annoying, most times helpful
- [Auto Complete Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-complete-tag) - Automatically closes AND renames both tags but you just type it once
- [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) - Highlights different types of comments like TODOs
- [Code Time](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.swdc-vscode) - Sends weekly reports showing how much time you spent coding
- [Discord Rich Presence](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeonardSSH.vscord) - Displays what you're doing on VS Code with a clean UI on Discord
- [ES7+ React Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) - Type ``rfce`` and it creates a React Functional component template for you
- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) - Shows file sizes of various imported stuff (lower is better xd)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - Only useful for vanilla HTML/CSS/JS projects but does hot-reloading like ``npm start``
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - 10/10 extension, set to format on save
- [Reload](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=natqe.reload) - Underrated but let's you reload VS Code but you don't have to close and reopen the whole app
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - Autocomplete for Tailwind Utility classes
- [Inline Fold](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moalamri.inline-fold) - Folds all Tailwind Utility classes cus sometimes they do be very long
